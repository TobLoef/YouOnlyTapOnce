# You Only Tap Once

![](http://i.imgur.com/i3PWDCb.png)

You Only Tap Once is a simple mobile game about chain reactions. It was created as a small test to get familiar with libGDX, a Java game framework, and GitHub in general. If you feel like downloading the game, or just want to view a few screenshots, you can take a look at the [Google Play page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tobloef.yoto.android). Currently the game is only avaiible for Android, as I can't afford the App Store developer fee.

It's my first game developed with libGDX, so if you find anything I could have done better, please feel free to create a pull request or let me know otherwise.
